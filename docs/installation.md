# Installation

Install the CLI via pip

`pip install pypp-cli`

It is recommended that you install pypp-cli globally and have it on your path so that you can use the cli, `pypp`, anywhere on your computer.

In order to build your generated C++ project, you will need CMake installed.

Also in order to build your generated C++ project, you will need a C++ compiler installed. You should be able to use any compiler you wish (I have tested most with clang/clang++ and MSVC).

In order to format your generated C++ code, you will need clang-format installed. If you already have the clang compiler installed you likely have clang-format. If not, you can install clang-format it separately.

Lastly, you'll want Python installed.
