# Installation

Install the CLI via pip

`pip install pypp-cli`

It is recommended that you install pypp-cli globally and have it on your path so that you can use the CLI anywhere on your computer.

To build your generated C++ project, you will need CMake installed.

Also, to build your generated C++ project, you will need a C++ compiler installed. You should be able to use any compiler you wish (I have tested most with clang/clang++ and MSVC).

To format your generated C++ code, you will need clang-format installed. If you already have the clang compiler installed, you likely have clang-format. If not, you can install clang-format separately.

Lastly, you'll want Python installed.

## Compatible versions
