# Donate

## Py++ Foundation

In the future, we can create a Py++ foundation if there is interest. There is no such foundation right now.

## Support me

I will tell you what your money will be going to if you donate to me, the lead and sole developer on the Py++ project so far.

I'll give a little bit of backstory to myself.

I quit my well-paying software engineering job with AWS in June 2024 because I wanted to work on projects that I felt could be of a lot more usefulness to people, and because I knew that working on challenging projects would do much more for developing my software engineering/programming skills. I am very much obsessed with innovative and useful technology, and with doing excellent work.

So, if you do choose to donate, **you will be supporting me so I can continue on my mission of making innovative, useful technology for people and doing excellent work**. In the near term, you will be supporting my work on Py++, because if I do get donations, it will be a hint for me to continue to focus my energy on Py++. I have been putting my free full-time energy into this project since June 1st 2025, and I will continue that for the foreseeable future.

In addition, you will be indirectly supporting future projects of mine that will, of course, aim to be the same thing: innovative, useful, and excellent. In the [below section](#potential-future-projects), I've listed some of the future projects I am debating at the moment.

### My current financial situation

I currently have no income, and my wife is unemployed without fantastic job prospects, so we are living off of our savings right now, which will last for another ~1.5 years. At the point our savings are almost out, if my wife isn't making more, or I don't start making income from my projects that are aligned with my mission, I'll have to do something else to acquire income, which will distract from my mission. But in such a case, I will always still be prioritizing my mission as much as possible.

### My donation links

#### PayPal

- [USD](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=AULDXVU3FRB22)
- [EUR](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7EPBYJSMGTYBQ)
- [All other currencies](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=CSVAS56KK4WVN)

If you are donating in USD or EUR, it's best to use those links because I can take the USD or EUR and convert them to my home currency of CAD at a better rate than PayPal offers (with Wise). For any other currency, it's best to use the last link because I get the donation in my home currency.

Also works through PayPal, but is more of a social platform.


### Potential future projects

- A successor to Py++, which will not transpile to C++ but directly to assembly code. The syntax could maybe change, and maybe different ways of high-level programming could be invented, to increase performance even beyond C-level performance, or to make things easier and understandable.
- An operating system built on the language in the last bullet point, or if that is not possible, built on Py++ or a special version of Py++. The thing that would be innovative, useful and excellent about this operating system is that at any level of the system, someone could fork it with ease and build their own thing up from that level, as I will explicitly document that and aim for it. I will try to build up the core components, level-by-level, and make it super easy for people to use my work to independently spin up their own ideas without my oversight (just like I've done with Py++).
- A video game where people can do real engineering design and simulation. Someone could build a factory or prototype a product in the game and then build it in real life into a real-life business. When you see how intensely young kids are creating complicated things in games like Minecraft today, I can see how they would enjoy actually building more real things.
- Remake some popular competitive mobile games with a different monetization model. All the games in this space are bad because they don't give you all the items unlocked, making the competition unfair because some people have more than others. With a different monetization model, people can play the games for hours, hours, and hours and just pay a few bucks or choose to watch ads instead of paying. And importantly, all the items will be unlocked from the beginning, so that the competition is fair.

Feel free to copy any of my ideas, because if someone builds it instead of me, then I might not have to build it myself!
