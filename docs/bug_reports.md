# Bug reporting

Bugs that you encounter can be reported in the [issues tab of the Py++ github page](https://github.com/curtispuetz/pypp-cli/issues). Remember to use the `Py++ bug` label.

A bug could be:

- Py++ code that does to behave as documented or as someone would reasonably expect it to behave
- Errors thrown by the Py++ CLI that are wrong or don't make sense
- Something that is not as performant in Py++ as it is in C++ with the same features
- Etc.
