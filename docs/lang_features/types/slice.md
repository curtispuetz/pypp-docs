# Slices

Like Pythons slices.

They are used to access multiple elements of lists and strings. However, slice assignment is not supported.

## Declaration

Same as Python

```python
def pseudo_fn():
    a: slice = slice(10, 2, -3)
```

## Slice attributes and methods

The slice attributes (`start`, `stop`, `step`) and method (`indices()`) are not supported.

## Other operations

- `print()`
