# Feature requests

## Making feature requests

Feature requests for the Py++ language can be made in the [issues tab of the Py++ github page](https://github.com/curtispuetz/pypp-cli/issues). If you think of something you'd like to have in Py++, I invite you to add it as a feature request. Remember to use the `Py++ feature request` label.

Also, **it will help a lot to give a 'thumbs up' to features that you want to see added**, because this way we can sort by the items which have the most 'thumbs up' in order to see which features are the most in demand.

## Current highest priority features

In my mind, these are the highest priority features that should be added to Py++, in an approximate order of importance. And, I am probably working on them now as you are reading this.

I will keep this list updated

- Default arguments for functions/methods and object instantiation
- Type variables (i.e. C++ template)
- Keyword arguments for calls
- Multi-threading/multi-processing
- Support for the `sum()` built-in function (or any other built-in functions we can think of that would be good)
- `set` operators: `|`, `^`, `&`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=` (low hanging fruit)
- The `dict` merge operator `|` (low hanging fruit)
- Magic methods (i.e. \_\_str\_\_, \_\_add\_\_, etc)
